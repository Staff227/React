Student Terms
</h3>
<p class="marked"><h2 id="1-student-terms">1. Student Terms</h2>
<p>Update: October 2023</p>
<p>between</p>
<p><strong>42 Heilbronn gGmbH</strong><br>with its registered office in Heilbronn<br>~ hereinafter also referred to as "<strong>42 Heilbronn</strong>" ~&nbsp;</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>[attendee/42 student] (Piscine attendee or official 42 student)<br>~ in the role of Piscine attendee hereinafter also referred to as <strong>“attendee”</strong> ~<br>~ in the role of official 42 student hereinafter also referred to as <strong>“42 student”</strong> ~  </p>
<p>~ both parties hereinafter also referred to as <strong><em>„the Parties“</em></strong> ~</p>
<h3 id="preamble">Preamble</h3>
<p>The Company is a non-profit corporation. Its purpose is to operate the programming school 42 Heilbronn ("42 Heilbronn"), which provides tuition-free and industry-leading training in the field of digital technologies and software development.</p>
<p>The primary goal of 42 Heilbronn is to help people become competent software developers, regardless of educational background or origin. The secondary goal is to strengthen the visibility and reputation of Heilbronn and thereby attract and develop talent.</p>
<p>Now therefore both parties agree upon the following:</p>
<h3 id="subject-of-the-contract">Subject of the contract</h3>
<p>Subject of the contract is the selection process(“Piscine”) and the study program (“curriculum”) at 42 Heilbronn.&nbsp;The following provisions apply in full to both the Piscine and the curriculum unless they apply expressly or in terms of their content only to the Piscine or the curriculum.</p>
<p>The model is structured in three stages:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1</strong>, related to status “attendee” - the Piscine which acts as a selection process over the course of three to four weeks. The status as attendee is already accompanied by certain rights and obligations and exists exclusively from the beginning of the Piscine (with confirmation of this contract) until the end of the Piscine (with official confirmation of the 42 Heilbronn about either successful participation or failed participation in the Piscine).</p>
<p><strong>Stages 2 and 3</strong>, related to status “42 student” – the curriculum, following individual admission of the 42 student after passing the Piscine. It consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>a basic training (“core curriculum”) which together comprise about 1,500 hours. Here, the fundamentals of programming are taught systematically: C programming, object-oriented programming, algorithms, networks and</li>
<li>a specialization, with advanced skills in different areas of programming (up to "Level 21"). For example, cyber security, app programming, machine learning, operating system architecture.</li>
</ul>
<p>The curriculum is designed to an average of three years and ends basically with the termination of this contract either by the 42 student or by the 42 Heilbronn (e.g. through blackhole) or after completion of the 42 student’s individual training.</p>
<h3 id="duties-of-the-parties-nbsp-">Duties of the parties&nbsp;</h3>
<h4 id="duties-of-42-heilbronn-nbsp-">Duties of 42 Heilbronn&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>To give the attendee a free of charge opportunity to pursue the Piscine. The opportunity may be taken again by the attendee <strong>once</strong> after 365 days if the Piscine is not passed the first time. For this purpose, a new registration and confirmation of these terms are required by the attendee.</li>
<li>To give the 42 student the opportunity to pursue the curriculum at 42 Heilbronn after passing the Piscine and without charging tuition fees after having started the core curriculum.</li>
<li>To provide the attendee and the 42 student with access to the 42 World intranet and other appropriate tools.</li>
<li>To grant the attendees (in case the Piscine is held in person) and the 42 students access to the necessary premises by providing the 42 students / attendees with a campus card).</li>
<li>To provide the attendees and the 42 students with appropriate IT equipment at the 42 Heilbronn location at Weipertstraße 8-10. </li>
<li>To issue an "end of curriculum certificate" after completion of the learning content, showing the level and skills achieved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>To provide resume function to the 42 student: An online resume is available for each 42 student. After the core part of the curriculum, every 42 student can design and make visible an own resume on the 42 intranet.</li>
<li>To provide the 42 students with learning opportunities in the local ecosystem and community.</li>
</ul>
<p>To financially support attendees and 42 students in their education and in their livelihood by providing a scholarship according to status.</p>
<h4 id="basic-scholarship-nbsp-">Basic Scholarship&nbsp;</h4>
<p>For the duration of the Piscine and the curriculum respectively, each attendee or 42 student (both hereinafter also referred to as “scholarship holder”) receives a basic scholarship ("scholarship") offered by 42 Heilbronn. The scholarship is granted with signature (respectively checking the box) of the section “scholarship” of this contract without further requirements. It serves to promote the participation in the Piscine of the attendee and the education of the 42 students and is intended to support each scholarship holder to cover the associated livelihood, training needs and costs. </p>
<p>In the event of not passing the Piscine (for the first time or finally) or not meeting student requirements, discontinuation of the program or after completion of the program the scholarship holder is not obliged to repay the scholarship. The acceptance of the scholarship is not linked to any consideration in return, especially it does not oblige the scholarship holder to any scientific consideration or to any employee activity. </p>
<p>The scholarship is awarded independently of other income of the scholarship holder during the Piscine and the curriculum.</p>
<p>The scholarship is aimed to be tax-free within the framework of the provision of §&nbsp;3&nbsp;No. 44 German EStG (German Income Tax Law). It is granted by 42 Heilbronn unselfishly, in particular it does not constitute remuneration within the meaning of §&nbsp;14 of German SGB IV (German Sozialgesetzbuch IV). </p>
<p>42 Heilbronn supports the scholarship holder according to status as follows:</p>
<h5 id="accommodation-in-a-local-youth-hostel-only-if-available-">Accommodation in a local youth hostel (only if available)</h5>
<p>42 offers youth hostel (or similar) support for students during the piscine, where 42 Heilbronn takes over 58% of the cost and the cost for discounted meals and the student 42%.
The Piscine takes place in Heilbronn, so that students who do not live in Heilbronn or the surrounding area [50 kilometers to the city centre] need overnight accommodation on site. 42 Heilbronn reserves in advance and without obligation certain contingents in local youth hostels or similar, which may be rented by the student. A current list of the existing contingents can be distributed by 42. 42 Heilbronn covers only the costs in the youth hostel as indicated above. All additional costs charged by the youth hostel are to be paid by the student. The costs covered by 42 Heilbronn are settled directly between the youth hostel and 42 Heilbronn.</p>
<h5 id="discounted-meals-in-the-canteens-only-offered-for-attendees-if-personalized-42-card-exists-">Discounted meals in the canteens (only offered for attendees if personalized 42 card exists)</h5>
<p>On the educational campus in Heilbronn (Bildungscampus) there are several canteens operated by the Studierendenwerk Heidelberg. The scholarship is intended to help the scholarship holder to cover the general necessities of living during the education, including discounted meals on campus. Therefore, and by abbreviated payment method, 42 Heilbronn pays the respective difference of the meals purchased by its scholarship holders in the canteens operated by the Studierendenwerk Heidelberg between the discounted consumer group “students” and the regular consumer group “guests” monthly in total to the Studierendenwerk. Payments by the scholarship holder in the canteens must be made cashless via the 42 Card. In the case of cash payment by the scholarship holder, no appropriate compensation will be paid by 42 Heilbronn to the Studierendenwerk Heidelberg. In addition, the scholarship holder is not entitled to a subsequent refund of the difference against 42 Heilbronn.</p>
<h5 id="use-of-the-semester-ticket-for-42-students-in-the-heilbronn-public-transport-network-not-offered-for-attendees-">Use of the "Semester-Ticket" for 42 students in the Heilbronn public transport network (not offered for attendees)</h5>
<p> In order to fund the education through easy access to local transport to reach the 42 Heilbronn conveniently at any time, 42 Heilbronn enables 42&nbsp;students in the local transport association ("HNV") to use public transport at a reduced price. HNV grants eligible 42 students the opportunity to purchase a semester-long and discounted half-year ticket valid for the duration of one semester ("Semester Ticket"). A 42 student has the opportunity to purchase the semester ticket at a reduced price upon presentation of the 42 Card at the HNV sales outlets or on campus. 42&nbsp;Heilbronn bears a solidarity contribution of EUR&nbsp;17.00 per semester ticket, which it is directly paid to the HNV.</p>
<p>42 Heilbronn concludes corresponding agreements with participating youth hostels, HNV and the operators of the canteens, which enables the scholarship holders to use the above-mentioned services directly at a reduced price in accordance with the scholarship holder’s status and the procedure described above. However, 42 Heilbronn does not guarantee any third-party availabilities or services. The scholarship holder is not entitled to any kind of direct payment of financial subsidies (no cash payment) by 42 Heilbronn. Deviating agreements in this context are inadmissible.</p>
<h4 id="duties-of-the-attendee-42-student-nbsp-">Duties of the attendee/42 student&nbsp;</h4>
<h5 id="adherence-to-the-house-and-building-rules-nbsp-">Adherence to the house and building rules&nbsp;</h5>
<p>The attendee/42 student complies with the house rules of the educational campus (<strong>Annex&nbsp;1</strong>), the code of conduct (<strong>Annex&nbsp;2</strong>) and the locker terms (<strong>Annex 3</strong>) for the use of the 42 Heilbronn building. These rules might be subject to change. The attendee/the 42 student is obliged to actively inform themselves about changes. The current form can be viewed in Annex 1 and 2 or can be obtained from the staff of 42 Heilbronn and as a free to access document in the Spaceship.</p>
<h5 id="comply-with-the-values-of-42-in-particular-with-regard-to">Comply with the values of 42, in particular with regard to</h5>

<h5 id="comply-with-the-42-heilbronn-curriculum-nbsp-">Comply with the 42 Heilbronn curriculum&nbsp;</h5>
<ul>
<li>The curriculum uses projects. This is part of the gamification process. Attendees/42 students should follow the projects. Some projects are connected to a blackhole (see below).</li>
<li>Next to the regular curriculum, a lot of events will occur. They can be conferences, hackathons, meet-up, workshops, etc. The intranet allows attendees/42&nbsp;students to create such events and manage sign-up. Each exam needs a dedicated event.</li>
<li>In case an attendee/42 student breaches community rules, the staff imposes community services. The goal is for the attendee/42 student to give back some time to the community.</li>
<li>Attendees/42 students have to participate in peer evaluation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Attendees/42 students have to participate in exams. Cheating during exams or the regular course of the curriculum is not allowed and will be sanctioned.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Once the core part at the beginning of the curriculum is done, 42 students can access internships. Any internship is forbidden during the core part.</li>
<li>Each campus can define its own access rules beyond the core part, it can be optional, mandatory, part-time, full time (or both).</li>
<li>The main curriculum is followed by the post-core part of the curriculum. It provides many projects and advanced type of problems the 42 students have to choose and participate in.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="adhere-to-a-minimum-learning-progress-blackhole-as-defined-by-the-42-intranet-nbsp-">Adhere to a minimum learning progress ("blackhole" as defined by the 42 intranet)&nbsp;</h5>
<ul>
<li>The blackhole is a moving deadline for 42 students to finish up their projects within the core curriculum. When 42 students start the curriculum, they will have a certain amount of days to finish up their first project. After each completed project, more days are added to avoid the blackhole.</li>
<li>The blackhole is designed to offer more time than what a regular 42 student should take to complete projects. If a 42 student regularly works on the projects with moderate progress, it should not be an issue.</li>
<li>The rules of the blackhole might change over time, the current rule is available and implemented on the intranet of 42. Therefore, the 42&nbsp;students are held to consult the homepage periodically.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="comply-to-the-terms-of-the-scholarship">Comply to the terms of the scholarship</h5>
<ul>
<li>The scholarship holder agrees to the terms of the scholarship offered by 42 Heilbronn and will observe the procedure required for the use of the funded services as described. </li>
<li>The scholarship holder will adhere to the house rules of the respective youth hostel, the canteens as well as the conditions of carriage of the transport association. </li>
</ul>
<h5 id="cheating">Cheating</h5>
<ul>
<li>42 Heilbronn provides an online learning platform. Cheating or gaming the system is strictly prohibited.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Examples of what is considered cheating during the Piscine or the exams: no external sources of information or communication with other attendees/42 students are allowed. Projects have to be designed and solved by attendees/42 students themselves, copying code is not allowed.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If attendees/42 students are detected cheating, appropriate measures like reduction in points up to termination can be taken by the 42 staff.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="announcements">Announcements</h5>
<p>At any time, attendees/42 students note and follow announcements of 42 Heilbronn entirely.</p>
<h5 id="equipment">Equipment</h5>
<p>The equipment provided (movable and immovable objects) is to be treated with care at all times and any damage that occurs and is detected is to be reported immediately.&nbsp;Attendees/42 students are liable for every kind of damage in case of intent or gross negligence just as well if they do not report any kind of damage immediately to the 42 Heilbronn staff.</p>
<h5 id="software-amp-accounts">Software &amp; Accounts</h5>
<p>42 Heilbronn provides attendees/42 students with software and accounts for online tools. 42&nbsp;students are obliged to only use software and accounts for study purposes and safeguard passwords. 42 Heilbronn reserves the right to block 42 students temporarily or permanently from software or tool-access in case of breach.</p>
<h5 id="private-liability-insurance-nbsp-">Private liability insurance&nbsp;</h5>
<p>Furthermore, attendees/42 students are liable for any damages, financial losses and personal injuries they cause during the Piscine and their studies at 42 Heilbronn. Therefore, 42 Heilbronn strongly recommends that 42 students hold a private liability insurance.</p>
<h5 id="42-card-also-referred-to-as-campus-card-">42 Card (also referred to as “campus card”)</h5>
<ul>
<li>With the official beginning of the curriculum, 42 students will be issued an individually assigned multifunctional campus card, herein referred to as the "42 Card", upon completion of the contract. If a Piscine is held in the premises of 42 (no online-Piscine) the attendees will receive a 42 Card for the duration of the Piscine. </li>
<li>The 42 card allows access to the 42 Heilbronn building. </li>
<li>In case of revocation or termination of the contract or the end of a Piscine, the issuance of the card does not entitle the attendee/42 student to use the 42 Heilbronn building. The 42 card must immediately be returned after revocation or termination of the contract or at the end of a Piscine. </li>
<li>In the event of a loss or damage of a 42 Card for which the attendee/42 student is responsible, the activation fee of a replacement card of EUR 20.00 is due.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If, in the event of reissue, the attendee/42 student proves that less damage or no damage at all has been incurred, the attendee/42 student shall only owe the amount proven.</li>
<li>The previous 42 Card loses its validity with the activation of the replacement 42&nbsp;Card.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The attendee/42 student undertakes to ensure the safekeeping of the 42 Card. The respective attendee/42 student must immediately report the loss of the 42 Card to 42 Heilbronn in writing. After reporting the loss, the functions of the 42 Card will be blocked and from this point on, the attendee/42 student will be released from the risk of its misuse (e. g. by third parties).&nbsp;</li>
<li>The 42 Card cannot be transferred. The attendee/42 student is obliged to use the 42 Card exclusively personally, not to give it to third parties.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In order to ensure that the 42 Card is exclusively used by the attendee/42 student, the attendee/42 student shall provide 42 Heilbronn with a photo of himself/herself, which shall be stored by 42 Heilbronn. If no photo is available, 42 Heilbronn reserves the right to verify the identity by means of a photo ID check prior to the access to the 42 Heilbronn building.&nbsp;</li>
<li>42 Heilbronn reserves the right to announce further rights and obligations of the attendee/42 students regarding the 42 Card. </li>
</ul>
<h5 id="appropriate-use-of-means-of-communication">Appropriate use of means of communication</h5>
<ul>
<li>The attendee/42 student shall refrain from any inappropriate use of the Internet and should adhere to the available means of communication. In particular any intentional or knowing use of the electronic communication systems that is likely to harm the interests of 42 Heilbronn or its reputation in the public, to impair the security of the IT system, or that violates applicable legal provisions is impermissible.</li>
<li>In the interest of all attendees/42 students, the Internet connection on site shall primarily be used for study purposes. Downloading or uploading large files for other purposes as well as occupying bandwidth with streams is not permitted.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="duration-termination-amp-de-registration">Duration, Termination &amp; De-Registration</h3>
<p>The contract with the attendee terminates immediately in case of not passing the Piscine. </p>
<p>Once attendees have passed the Piscine and have officially become a 42 student by successful admission the contract is valid for an indefinite period of time as long as it is not terminated by 42 Heilbronn for cause (see below).</p>
<p>For the 42 student a leave of absence is possible in the form of a "Freeze". The freeze system allows each 42 student to manage a break in the curriculum. A maximum of three freezes are allowed, for a maximum total duration of six months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Freeze is meant to spend time dedicated to solving an external issue or taking a leave of absence. During such a break, access to the resources of 42 is prohibited (intranet, building, etc.).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attendee/42 student may leave 42 Heilbronn on own request and at any time. For this purpose, notification of the wish to terminate is required to 42 Heilbronn. Upon the attendee’s/42 student’s departure, the contract ends automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contract can be terminated by 42 Heilbronn with immediate effect of termination, if&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>the admission has been obtained by providing incorrect or incomplete information;&nbsp;</li>
<li>the attendee/42 student seriously or repeatedly (more than two times) violates the obligations, especially with regard to the values of 42 Heilbronn and compliance with the house rules;&nbsp;</li>
<li>the&nbsp;42 student’s progress is not sufficient ("blackhole" as mentioned above).</li>
</ul>
<p>The right of the contracting parties to extraordinary termination for cause remains unaffected by the above provisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Immediately upon termination of the contractual relationship and departure of the attendee/42 student, all items/equipment including the 42 Card are to be handed over by the attendee/42 student to the staff of 42 Heilbronn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This contract may be subject to changes and amendments. 42 Heilbronn will inform the attendee/42 student about any changes and amendments and request their consent if necessary. The attendee’s/42 student’s consent to the contract in its current form is the prerequisite to participate in the entire 42 Heilbronn program. Failure to give consent by a time specified by 42 Heilbronn will result in an automatic termination of the contractual relationship.</p>
<h3 id="liability-nbsp-">Liability&nbsp;</h3>
<p>42 Heilbronn accepts no liability for whether an attendee will pass the Piscine or a 42 student will pass examinations within the curriculum or reach a certain goal or level in their learning at 42 Heilbronn. The liability of 42 Heilbronn, for whatever legal reason, in connection with the use of the premises and the commute to and from the premises &amp; building, is limited to intent and gross negligence. Exceptions are accidents on the university premises, against which the attendees/42 students are insured by 42 Heilbronn. The attendee/42 student is responsible to report accidents to staff immediately. The above liability provisions apply equally to employees and other parties.</p>
<p>In the case of slight negligence, 42 Heilbronn shall only be liable in the event of a breach of material contractual obligations (cardinal obligations) in connection with the performance of the contract. In these cases, however, the amount of liability shall be limited to the damage foreseeable at the time of conclusion of the contract and typical for the contract, as well as in the case of personal injury. Cardinal obligations are those obligations that make the proper execution of the contract possible in the first place and on whose compliance the attendee/42 student may regularly rely.</p>
<h3 id="copyright">Copyright</h3>
<p>The copyright to learning documentation, projects, scripts, specific data provided for the curriculum or other learning material made available during the program belongs solely to the 42, or the respective author or producer.</p>
